#### Creating virtual threads

The constructors of the _Thread_ class and its subclasses can only create platform threads.The sealed _Thread.Builder_ interface provides greater ability to create threads than the constructors. The _Thread.Builder.OfPlatform_ subinterface could create platform threads, and the _Thread.Builder.OfVirtual_ subinterface could create virtual threads.


###### Creating platform threads from constructors

The following example creates a platform thread from a constructor.


```
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("run!"));
assertTrue(thread.isPlatform());
assertFalse(thread.isVirtual());
thread.join();
```



###### Creating platform and virtual threads from builders

The following example creates a platform thread from an implementation of the _Thread.Builder.OfPlatform_ interface that is returned from the _Thread.ofPlatform()_ method.


```
Thread thread = Thread.ofPlatform().start(() -> System.out.println("run"));
assertTrue(thread.isPlatform());
thread.join();
```


The following example creates a virtual thread from an implementation of the _Thread.Builder.ofVirtual_ interface that is returned from the _Thread.ofVirtual()_ method.


```
Thread thread = Thread.ofVirtual().start(() -> System.out.println("run"));
assertTrue(thread.isVirtual());
thread.join();
```


The following example creates a virtual thread and implicitly starts it in the builder.


```
Thread.Builder builder = Thread.ofVirtual();
Thread thread = builder.start(() -> { sleep(1000); System.out.println("run"); });
assertEquals(Thread.State.RUNNABLE, thread.getState());
thread.join();
```


The following example creates a virtual thread and then explicitly starts it.


```
Thread.Builder builder = Thread.ofVirtual();
Thread thread = builder.unstarted(() -> System.out.println("run"));
assertEquals(Thread.State.NEW, thread.getState());
thread.start();
assertEquals(Thread.State.RUNNABLE, thread.getState());
thread.join();
```


The following example creates a platform thread with all the options available in the _Thread.Builder.ofPlatform_ thread builder interface.


```
Thread.Builder builder = Thread.ofPlatform()
   .group(Thread.currentThread().getThreadGroup())
   .daemon(false)
   .priority(10)
   .stackSize(1024)
   .name("platform thread")
   .inheritInheritableThreadLocals(false)
   .uncaughtExceptionHandler((t, e) -> System.out.printf("Thread %s failed with exception %s", t, e));
Thread thread = builder.unstarted(() -> System.out.println("run"));

assertEquals("platform thread", thread.getName());
assertEquals("main", thread.getThreadGroup().getName());
assertFalse(thread.isDaemon());
assertEquals(10, thread.getPriority());
```


The following example creates a virtual thread with all the options available in the _Thread.Builder.OfVirtual_ thread builder interface.


```
Thread.Builder builder = Thread.ofVirtual()
   .name("virtual thread")
   .inheritInheritableThreadLocals(false)
   .uncaughtExceptionHandler((t, e) -> System.out.printf("Thread %s failed with exception %s", t, e));
Thread thread = builder.unstarted(() -> System.out.println("run"));

assertEquals("virtual thread", thread.getName());
assertEquals("VirtualThreads", thread.getThreadGroup().getName());
assertTrue(thread.isDaemon());
assertEquals(5, thread.getPriority());
```


The previous example shows that the following parameters cannot be specified when creating virtual threads:



* thread group (always "VirtualThreads")
* daemon (always _true_)
* priority(always 5)
* stack size


###### Creating virtual threads from thread factory

Builders are the best alternative to constructors (see "Effective Java" 3rd edition by Joshua Bloch, items 1, 2). Interface _Thread.Builder_ was added in Java 21 and is not yet widely used. Much wider use is made of the _ThreadFactory_ interface, which was added in Java 1.5. The _Thread.Builder.factory_ interface method returns a thread-safe _ThreadFactory_ instance to create threads from the current state of the builder.

The following example creates a virtual thread from a factory created from the current state of the builder.


```
Thread.Builder builder = Thread.ofVirtual()
   .name("virtual thread");
ThreadFactory threadFactory = builder.factory();
Thread thread = threadFactory.newThread(() -> System.out.println("run"));

assertEquals("virtual thread", thread.getName());
assertEquals(Thread.State.NEW, thread.getState());
